# novusphere-db (node js impl.) A MongoDB based database API for interacting with data indexed from an underlying blockchain## Build Setup  ``` bash# install dependenciesnpm install# start processnpm start``` ## Recommended Tools[.NET Core Framework](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/) (not required)[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)[npm for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.vscode-npm-script)[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)[MongoDB Reference](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/)## Notes for eos pluginBy default in `config.json` the script plugin is set to `eosflareapi` which uses an API provided by [EOS Flare](https://eosflare.io) to synchronize nsdb. Optionally, the script can be set to `bpapi` interchangeably which uses the now deprecated history API.Special thanks to- [EOS Flare](https://eosflare.io)- [Greymass](http://greymass.com/)- Others working on improving the history API## Notes for using eos-forum locallynsdb is configured by default at start up to begin listening to both the `eosforumrcpp` contract and `novuspheredb` contract on the EOS main net blockchain.[Download the gh-pages zip](https://github.com/Novusphere/eos-forum/tree/gh-pages) or [compile](https://github.com/Novusphere/eos-forum) eos-forum's front end interface and then open it locally in your browser. At the top middle area of the interface, click "Settings" and then "Raw" and change `novusphere_api` to `http://localhost:8099` or whatever end point you have novusphere-db listening to. Hit "Save" and your interface should now be using your own local novusphere-db node.
